## Minutes of the AGM 2025
Sunday 9 March 2025

### Welcome and Introductions
The Chairman made the necessary welcome and introductions.

### Confirmation of a quorum
There are currently 58 members with a 10% requirement to have 5.8 members present, rounded to 6. There were 6 leaseholders present.

### Chairperson's report
Leaseholders had been sent a very full report on the chief issues facing RLA in 2025 and beyond. There was a recognition of the dynamic leadership of the Chairman, whose work in holding First Port and others to account has been significant.

### Secretary's report
The Secretary gave a verbal report to say that there are currently 58 members but 42 apartments unrepresented. First Port are unable to release names and postal addresses of those 42 leaseholders due to data protection law. We continue to pick up new names in passing and by chance.

### Treasurer’s report
There are no accounts as there is no membership fee and therefore no bank account.

### Committee Elections
All five members of the current committee are required to stand down and are willing to stand again.

Proposal – By Jencir lee and seconded by Anne Perkins, that the committee is re-appointed en bloc. The motion was upheld unanimously

### Change to the Constitution
It was proposed by Rochelle Pereira and seconded by John Morgan that those parts of the constitution which refer to membership fees and finance are suspended until such time as a final decision is taken at a future general meeting.
The motion was carried by a majority of 9 with 1 abstention.

The constitution will continue to have all matters of membership and finance suspended until such time as it is considered necessary to lift the suspension.

### Objection to the presence of the Aspire Drug Re-habilitation Centre
This centre has been in Lower Bridge Street since 2009. Gus Wallace informed the meeting that the centre’s lease is due to be discussed at a meeting in October 2025 with the lease due for renewal in April 2026. 

It was proposed by Jencir Lee and seconded by Gus Wallace that RLA is opposed to any extension of Aspire’s licence/lease at their current premises due to the anti-social behaviour we are experiencing as a result of the centre’s close proximity to our homes. The motion was carried unanimously.

### Future events
The next committee meeting is to be arranged but should be on a Sunday in April before the 16th.

The next meeting between First Port and RLA will take place via ‘Teams’ on Wednesday the 16th of April between 14.30 and 15.30

## Notes of the general discussion
* The large part of informal discussion was taken up by member Bob Hamilton’s concern about the condition of the carpets in communal areas and staircases throughout Rivergate. He requested that the matter be brought up at our meeting with First Port with a view to planned replacement.
* The work of Nick Fruncillo, the caretaker for the site, was recognised  to be of the highest quality. He often carried out works which are over and beyond the call of duty. The site would be a poorer place without him. It was suggested that the committee write to him (copy to First Port) to express our sincere thanks for the work he does.
* A discussion was had on capital works. Gus Wallace advised that that FP are required to have a ten year programme of capital works so as to spread the impact of maintenance charges to leaseholders and to uphold the quality of the premises. The matter to be brought up at the next FP/RLA meeting.
