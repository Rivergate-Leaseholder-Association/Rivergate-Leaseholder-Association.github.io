## Neighbourhood Security
The [Anti-Social Behaviour team](mailto:antisocialbehaviour@peterborough.gov.uk) and [PC Dave Holland](mailto:Dave.Holland@cambs.police.uk) work on our neighbourhood.

1. Raise to [the StreetLink](https://thestreetlink.org.uk/) about homeless staying;

2. To raise about suspicious activity, crimes or offences, go to [https://www.cambs.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/soh/seen-or-heard/](https://www.cambs.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/soh/seen-or-heard/). Click on nothing but the last button "Report something else" to start reporting. This *must* be done for producing an official record. Keep the case reference number. Call 999 if in emergency.

## Waste Collection
The [Recycling team](mailto:recycling@peterborough.gov.uk) is headed by Amy Nebel [Amy.Nebel@peterborough.gov.uk](mailto:Amy.Nebel@peterborough.gov.uk).

Our collection day is Wednesday. Report any missed collection to the council (01733 747474) by Thursday end of day.

### Collection Schedule and Bin Store Enlargement
The Churchill House is always at biweekly collection.

For Admiral and Burlington Houses, the green bins are being collected biweekly, but the black bins weekly for limited bin store capacity. The bin stores are being enlarged to fully switch to biweekly collection, as required by the council.

### The Green Bin for Recyclables
Do not leave the following items in the green bins, or the "penalty" fee is £200+.

- black bags, even if they contain only recyclable items
- clothing
- food or other non-recyclable waste
- etc

### Large or Electrical Items Disposal
Take them to the Household Recycling Centre (HRC) in Fengate, or call the council (01733 747474) to book collection of up to six items for circa £30. If dumped anywhere in Rivergate, it costs £300+ to have them removed, which is unnecessary -- we need funds for *real* maintenance.
