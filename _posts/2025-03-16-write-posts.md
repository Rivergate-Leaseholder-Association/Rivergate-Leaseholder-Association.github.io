This site is set up and hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). Click on "Blogging with Jekyll" at the bottom of the page for the writing guide in the Markdown syntax.

Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Refer to the source of the posts already in this directory for further examples of writing in Markdown. Just do `git commit`, `git push` to visualise the change on [this site](/).

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.
